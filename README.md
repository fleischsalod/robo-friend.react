<h1>Robo Friends</h1>
<p>This is a little Website, that I created in the online Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer im 2018" by Andrei Neagoie.<p>
<p>It's built with React and in the base Version you can scroll to a list of Robots (data from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and filter them. The website is fully responsive and my first project, that I built with react.js.</p>
