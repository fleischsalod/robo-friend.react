<h1>Robo Friends Application</h1>
<p>This is a little web-application, that I created in the online Udemy-Course  "The Complete Web Developer im 2018"  by Andrei Neagoie.<p>
<p>It's built with React and in the base version you can scroll through a list of robots (data from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and filter them.<br>
This application is fully responsive and my first react.js-project.</p>
